# MSCloudLoginAssistant
A module for checking the current status of (and as required, prompting for login to) connections to various Microsoft Cloud platforms like Teams, Azure, and SharePoint Online.

This fork is more focused on using application identity and/or delegated permissions with a persisted TokenCache to enable usage of all of the platforms from a noninteractive use case.
